# Static Website Setup on VPS (DigitalOcean)

## Overview
This guide will help you set up a static website on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) using DigitalOcean. The process includes setting up a droplet, installing necessary tools, and deploying your Hugo-based website with Nginx. Optional steps such as configuring a custom domain and enabling HTTPS are also covered.

## Prerequisites
- DigitalOcean account
- Basic knowledge of using Linux commands
- A computer running Debian 12 (or the ability to install it)

## Key Steps

### 1. Create a Droplet on DigitalOcean
Create a new droplet, add your SSH key for secure access, and choose Debian 12 as your operating system.

### 2. Connect to Your Droplet
SSH into your droplet to begin setting up the environment.

### 3. Install Hugo Extended
Download and install Hugo Extended to manage the website's content. This includes extracting and verifying the Hugo binary and setting it up in your system path.

### 4. Set Up Hugo Website
Create a Hugo website, add a theme, generate demo content, and preview it locally before moving it to your VPS.

### 5. Set Up Nginx
Install and configure Nginx on your droplet to serve the static files generated by Hugo. Test the configuration to ensure the web server works correctly.

### 6. Upload the Website to the VPS
Build the Hugo site locally, upload the static files to the VPS, and configure Nginx to serve them.

### 7. Configure Nginx and Final Setup
Edit the Nginx configuration file to serve your website and restart the server. 

### Optional Steps:
- **Custom Domain**: Point your domain to your droplet's IP and update Nginx configuration.
- **HTTPS**: Use Certbot to secure your site with HTTPS and configure Nginx accordingly.

### 8. Content Management
Modify the content of your Hugo website by editing files locally, previewing changes, and uploading the updated files to your VPS.

## Troubleshooting
If your site is redirecting incorrectly, update the `baseURL` in your Hugo configuration file to your droplet's IP or custom domain.

## Final Notes
The server will be available for showcasing purposes until December 27th at [http://138.197.141.218](http://138.197.141.218).
